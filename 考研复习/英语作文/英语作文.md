In contrast, single-minded rejection can leave us bilnd and conceited.`

`The picture appears to offer an inspiring glimpse into how we behave towards our environment. As can be seen that, two tourists sit and eat snacks in a boat, casually throwing their rubbish into the river which is full of pollutants.`

`Tapping into such a phenomenon that, people's misbehavior have weighed on our beautiful landscape, and much of this can be blamed on our lack of environmental awareness. Admittedly, modernization, urbanization and industrialization have put us on the trajectory of rapid development while bringing us great convenience. However, on the filp side, man-made damage is felt everywhere in day-to-day life, and it's actually exemplified by the case illustrated in the above picutre. For this reason, we should recalibrate our way of interacting with the environment since sustainable development is subject to the harmonious coexistence between man and nature`.

`Therefore, at the center of this issue is the need of to reduce pollution from all source. This is the right approach for us to protect our environmental future, and it will put everyone in a better position to embrace out nature`.

`The picture appears to offer a thought-provoking glimpse into how we behave towards our environment. As can be seen, there are two tourists going sightseeing by a boat, casually throwing more rubbish into the river, which is already full of pollutants.`

`Tapping into the importance of ensuring our path to development, there is every reason to protect the environment, which is the basis for the sustainable development of people. Yet in reality, many individuals focus soley on their own convenience while neglecting the damage to the environment due to their misbehavior. At the heart of such a phenomenon is that people don't recognize that protecting the environment is equivalent to protecting ourselves. Endless exploitation and destruction of nature will ultimately lead to our own downfall.

`In a nutshell, the path to the free and comprehensive development of human should be approached by a shift in mindset: translating our focus on "personal relaxation" into that on "development in harmony with the environment". Such a move may hold a particular possibility of changing the hot water of mediocrity to the steam of success.`

One of them feels disappointed about the waste water, by contrast, the other contemplates that it is lucky to remain half of water.`

Yet in reality, many individuals are poised to be upset merely due to a trivial setback and lose the courage to keep pushing forward. At the heart of such behavior is a revealing lack of passion for facing the challenge and pursuing excellence. However, keeping an optimistic attitude is the very condition to render the possibility of continuously gaining meaningful progress, while too much indulgence in losses will threaten our motivation and dynamics to advance in any field.`

`The drawing depicts a group of graduates standing at a crossroads, with several signs indicating different future paths such as seeking for a job, going aboard and so on. It suggests that individuals face various decisions about their future, each with its own set of challenges and uncertainties.

`The intended meaning of the picture is clear: when making decisions, particularly regarding one's career or life path, people are often torn between different options. Some may prioritize security, while others chase financial success or personal fulfillment. The picture highlights the fact that every choice involves trade-offs, and no single path guarantees happiness or success`.

`In my opinion, the message of this drawing is thought-provoking. Life is full of choices, and while we may feel pressure from societal expectations or personal desires, it is essential to follow our own values and interests. We should strive to explore different possibilities and take risks when necessary, as sticking to the safest or most conventional path may limit our growth and potential. In the end, it's not just about choosing a path but about having the courage to walk it with conviction.`

Second, our university could organize more sports competitions, which would motivate students to participate actively.

By contrast, on the right-hand side of the picture, the little girl has grown up, holding her aged mother into her arm.`

`Tapping into the essence of family love, there is every reason to be each other's leaning rock in a loving home. Yet in reality, children are poised to enjoy the unconditional parental love, but neglect to take care of their parents as growing into an adult. At the heart of such a phenomenon is a revealing lack of filial consciousness when they are mired in a world full of distractions. However, family warmth is the very condition to render the possibility of emotional well-being, while a lost sight of family bonds and affection may reduce our capacity to love as a person`.

As can be seen, four people are sitting around a table for a meal, yet none of them are engaging with each other. Instead, they are all absorbed in their own phones, neglecting the opportunity for real commuication. It's a party that is dominated by the mobile phone.`

`The message conveyed by the picture is clear: people are becoming increasingly addicted to their phones and are neglecting the face-to-face interactions. For the younger generation today, it's hard to imagine a time before the invention of mobiles phones. While phones offer us more freedom, knowledge, and convenience, they also imprison us in a sense. There is no doubt that as people become more reliant on their phones, they may lose the passion for real-life experiences. The frequent and warm social interactions of the past have now become a luxury. However, putting down our phones and exploring the beautiful world around us is essential to truly realizing the value of life`.

`To wrap it all up, the path to meaningful progress should be approached by a shift in mindset: translating our focus on phones into that on the beauty of world. Such a move may hold a particular promise of transform an ordinary, mundane life into one that is vibrant and full of success.`

`Tapping into the essence of being a good example for others, there is every reason that if we want to truly inspire and guide others, especially children, we must first embody the qualities we wish to see in them. Yet in reality, many people expect others to do things according to their ideas, but they themselves can't live up to the same standards. This principle applies beyond family life, extending to leadership, education, and teamwork. By setting a positive example, we not only earn respect but also create an environment where others feel encouraged to follow us`.

`To sum up, the pictures serve as a reminder that the power of influence lies not in words but in actions. If we wish to bring about change and inspire others to grow, we must first commit to living up the values we advocate`.

Secondly, if you are a foodie, you should not miss Spring Sunshine Road, which boasts the larest food court in our city. Lastly, Central museum will be perfect for you assuming you are interested in history.`

`Altough everyone has their own unique preferences, I am confident that these suggestions mentioned will be helpful. Don't hesitate to contact me at any time if you have any question.`

`The picture appears to offer an thought-provoking glimpse into "empty talk" versus "taking action". As can be seen, a man, instead of reading one word, is proud of his extensive book collection. By contrast, on the right-hand side of the picture, the man, with the aim of completing twenty books this year, is reading attentively.`

`Tapping into the importance of taking action, we have every reason to believe that we can truly achieve personal growth and progress only through real efforts and actions. Yet in reality, people are poised to make their plans but don't follow them. Regradless of the number of resources, the key lies to how to effectively use these resources and continue to practice, just like reading, the acquisition of knowledge lies not only in the possession of books, but also in continuous learning and thinking.`

`To sum up, the path to meaningful progress should be approached by a shift in mindset: translating our focus on "empty talk" into that on "taking action". Such a move may hold a particular promise of securing the highest opportunities for steering us into a fruitful future.`

`Tapping into the treasure of books, there is every reason to read for joy and for knowledge. Yet in practice, people are poised to line their walls with bookcases, only for decoration and a sense of satisfaction. At the heart of such behavior is an inability to see the difference between "having books" and "reading books". However, the act of massive reading is the very condition to boost your brain power, release your imagination and understand the world around you, while too much indulgence in false appearance can act as a drag on our personal growth.`

`In a nutshell, the path to benefiting from books should be approached by a shift in mindset: translating our focus on "having books" into that on "reading books". And it will secure the highest opportunities for steering us into a fruitful future.`

`The picture appears to offer a inspiring glimpse into the choice of "quitting" versus "persevering". As can be seen, a man, who appears to be exhausted, is going to give up in the way of climbing a mountain. By contrast, the other man is full of passion in facing of difficulties and encouraging his partner to brace up and go on after a rest`.

`Tapping into the essence of perseverance, there is every reason to move forward through hardships. Yet in reality, many individuals are poised to give up when things get tough, thinking that the end goal is unreachable. At the heart of such behavior is an inability to see that all things are diffcult before they are easy, and some people surrender even before they've truly begun. However, unyielding spirit is the very condition to overcome a seemingly unconquerable mountain, while too much indulgence in an easy life could threaten our motivation and dynamics to advance in any field`.

关于放弃与坚持的选择，这副图片充满启示. 如图，一个人在爬山途中想要放弃，说自己已经筋疲力尽。相比之下，另一个人充满面对困难的热情并鼓励他的同伴打起精神，休息一下继续爬.

鉴于坚持的本质，我们应该完全在困境中畏难前行。但是在现实中，许多人倾向于在事情变得困难时放弃，认为最终目标是遥不可及的。但是如此行为的核心是看不到事情在变得简单前总是困难，有些人甚至在他们真正开始前就放弃了。然而，只有具有坚韧不拔的精神，才能克服看似无法征服的困难，而过度沉迷于轻松的生活可能会使我们在任何领域都缺乏前进的动力。

总的来说，要取得有意义的进步，我们就应该转变思维方式：不再关注当前的困难，转为关注未来的收获。这样做尤其能让平庸转化为成功.

`persevering, perseverance` 坚持不懈.
`move forward through hardships` 畏难前行
`unyielding spirit` 不屈的精神.
